<a id='L1' name='L1'></a>                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<a id='L2' name='L2'></a>                       Version 3, 29 June 2007
<a id='L3' name='L3'></a>
<a id='L4' name='L4'></a> Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;
<a id='L5' name='L5'></a> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<a id='L6' name='L6'></a> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<a id='L7' name='L7'></a>
<a id='L8' name='L8'></a>                            Preamble
<a id='L9' name='L9'></a>
<a id='L10' name='L10'></a>  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
<a id='L11' name='L11'></a>software and other kinds of works.
<a id='L12' name='L12'></a>
<a id='L13' name='L13'></a>  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
<a id='L14' name='L14'></a>to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
<a id='L15' name='L15'></a>the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
<a id='L16' name='L16'></a>share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
<a id='L17' name='L17'></a>software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
<a id='L18' name='L18'></a>GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
<a id='L19' name='L19'></a>any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
<a id='L20' name='L20'></a>your programs, too.
<a id='L21' name='L21'></a>
<a id='L22' name='L22'></a>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
<a id='L23' name='L23'></a>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
<a id='L24' name='L24'></a>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
<a id='L25' name='L25'></a>them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<a id='L26' name='L26'></a>want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<a id='L27' name='L27'></a>free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
<a id='L28' name='L28'></a>
<a id='L29' name='L29'></a>  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
<a id='L30' name='L30'></a>these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
<a id='L31' name='L31'></a>certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
<a id='L32' name='L32'></a>you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
<a id='L33' name='L33'></a>
<a id='L34' name='L34'></a>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
<a id='L35' name='L35'></a>gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
<a id='L36' name='L36'></a>freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
<a id='L37' name='L37'></a>or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
<a id='L38' name='L38'></a>know their rights.
<a id='L39' name='L39'></a>
<a id='L40' name='L40'></a>  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
<a id='L41' name='L41'></a>(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
<a id='L42' name='L42'></a>giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
<a id='L43' name='L43'></a>
<a id='L44' name='L44'></a>  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
<a id='L45' name='L45'></a>that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
<a id='L46' name='L46'></a>authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
<a id='L47' name='L47'></a>changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
<a id='L48' name='L48'></a>authors of previous versions.
<a id='L49' name='L49'></a>
<a id='L50' name='L50'></a>  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
<a id='L51' name='L51'></a>modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
<a id='L52' name='L52'></a>can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
<a id='L53' name='L53'></a>protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
<a id='L54' name='L54'></a>pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
<a id='L55' name='L55'></a>use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
<a id='L56' name='L56'></a>have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
<a id='L57' name='L57'></a>products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
<a id='L58' name='L58'></a>stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
<a id='L59' name='L59'></a>of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
<a id='L60' name='L60'></a>
<a id='L61' name='L61'></a>  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<a id='L62' name='L62'></a>States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
<a id='L63' name='L63'></a>software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
<a id='L64' name='L64'></a>avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
<a id='L65' name='L65'></a>make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
<a id='L66' name='L66'></a>patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
<a id='L67' name='L67'></a>
<a id='L68' name='L68'></a>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<a id='L69' name='L69'></a>modification follow.
<a id='L70' name='L70'></a>
<a id='L71' name='L71'></a>                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<a id='L72' name='L72'></a>
<a id='L73' name='L73'></a>  0. Definitions.
<a id='L74' name='L74'></a>
<a id='L75' name='L75'></a>  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
<a id='L76' name='L76'></a>
<a id='L77' name='L77'></a>  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
<a id='L78' name='L78'></a>works, such as semiconductor masks.
<a id='L79' name='L79'></a>
<a id='L80' name='L80'></a>  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
<a id='L81' name='L81'></a>License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
<a id='L82' name='L82'></a>"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
<a id='L83' name='L83'></a>
<a id='L84' name='L84'></a>  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
<a id='L85' name='L85'></a>in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
<a id='L86' name='L86'></a>exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
<a id='L87' name='L87'></a>earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
<a id='L88' name='L88'></a>
<a id='L89' name='L89'></a>  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
<a id='L90' name='L90'></a>on the Program.
<a id='L91' name='L91'></a>
<a id='L92' name='L92'></a>  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
<a id='L93' name='L93'></a>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
<a id='L94' name='L94'></a>infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
<a id='L95' name='L95'></a>computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
<a id='L96' name='L96'></a>distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
<a id='L97' name='L97'></a>public, and in some countries other activities as well.
<a id='L98' name='L98'></a>
<a id='L99' name='L99'></a>  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
<a id='L100' name='L100'></a>parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
<a id='L101' name='L101'></a>a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
<a id='L102' name='L102'></a>
<a id='L103' name='L103'></a>  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
<a id='L104' name='L104'></a>to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
<a id='L105' name='L105'></a>feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
<a id='L106' name='L106'></a>tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
<a id='L107' name='L107'></a>extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
<a id='L108' name='L108'></a>work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
<a id='L109' name='L109'></a>the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
<a id='L110' name='L110'></a>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
<a id='L111' name='L111'></a>
<a id='L112' name='L112'></a>  1. Source Code.
<a id='L113' name='L113'></a>
<a id='L114' name='L114'></a>  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
<a id='L115' name='L115'></a>for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
<a id='L116' name='L116'></a>form of a work.
<a id='L117' name='L117'></a>
<a id='L118' name='L118'></a>  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
<a id='L119' name='L119'></a>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
<a id='L120' name='L120'></a>interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
<a id='L121' name='L121'></a>is widely used among developers working in that language.
<a id='L122' name='L122'></a>
<a id='L123' name='L123'></a>  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
<a id='L124' name='L124'></a>than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
<a id='L125' name='L125'></a>packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
<a id='L126' name='L126'></a>Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
<a id='L127' name='L127'></a>Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
<a id='L128' name='L128'></a>implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
<a id='L129' name='L129'></a>"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
<a id='L130' name='L130'></a>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
<a id='L131' name='L131'></a>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
<a id='L132' name='L132'></a>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
<a id='L133' name='L133'></a>
<a id='L134' name='L134'></a>  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
<a id='L135' name='L135'></a>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
<a id='L136' name='L136'></a>work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
<a id='L137' name='L137'></a>control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
<a id='L138' name='L138'></a>System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
<a id='L139' name='L139'></a>programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
<a id='L140' name='L140'></a>which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
<a id='L141' name='L141'></a>includes interface definition files associated with source files for
<a id='L142' name='L142'></a>the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
<a id='L143' name='L143'></a>linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
<a id='L144' name='L144'></a>such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
<a id='L145' name='L145'></a>subprograms and other parts of the work.
<a id='L146' name='L146'></a>
<a id='L147' name='L147'></a>  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
<a id='L148' name='L148'></a>can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
<a id='L149' name='L149'></a>Source.
<a id='L150' name='L150'></a>
<a id='L151' name='L151'></a>  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
<a id='L152' name='L152'></a>same work.
<a id='L153' name='L153'></a>
<a id='L154' name='L154'></a>  2. Basic Permissions.
<a id='L155' name='L155'></a>
<a id='L156' name='L156'></a>  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
<a id='L157' name='L157'></a>copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
<a id='L158' name='L158'></a>conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
<a id='L159' name='L159'></a>permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
<a id='L160' name='L160'></a>covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
<a id='L161' name='L161'></a>content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
<a id='L162' name='L162'></a>rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
<a id='L163' name='L163'></a>
<a id='L164' name='L164'></a>  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
<a id='L165' name='L165'></a>convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
<a id='L166' name='L166'></a>in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
<a id='L167' name='L167'></a>of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
<a id='L168' name='L168'></a>with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
<a id='L169' name='L169'></a>the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
<a id='L170' name='L170'></a>not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
<a id='L171' name='L171'></a>for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
<a id='L172' name='L172'></a>and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
<a id='L173' name='L173'></a>your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
<a id='L174' name='L174'></a>
<a id='L175' name='L175'></a>  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
<a id='L176' name='L176'></a>the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
<a id='L177' name='L177'></a>makes it unnecessary.
<a id='L178' name='L178'></a>
<a id='L179' name='L179'></a>  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
<a id='L180' name='L180'></a>
<a id='L181' name='L181'></a>  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
<a id='L182' name='L182'></a>measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
<a id='L183' name='L183'></a>11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
<a id='L184' name='L184'></a>similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
<a id='L185' name='L185'></a>measures.
<a id='L186' name='L186'></a>
<a id='L187' name='L187'></a>  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
<a id='L188' name='L188'></a>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
<a id='L189' name='L189'></a>is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
<a id='L190' name='L190'></a>the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
<a id='L191' name='L191'></a>modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
<a id='L192' name='L192'></a>users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
<a id='L193' name='L193'></a>technological measures.
<a id='L194' name='L194'></a>
<a id='L195' name='L195'></a>  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
<a id='L196' name='L196'></a>
<a id='L197' name='L197'></a>  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
<a id='L198' name='L198'></a>receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
<a id='L199' name='L199'></a>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
<a id='L200' name='L200'></a>keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
<a id='L201' name='L201'></a>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
<a id='L202' name='L202'></a>keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
<a id='L203' name='L203'></a>recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
<a id='L204' name='L204'></a>
<a id='L205' name='L205'></a>  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
<a id='L206' name='L206'></a>and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
<a id='L207' name='L207'></a>
<a id='L208' name='L208'></a>  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
<a id='L209' name='L209'></a>
<a id='L210' name='L210'></a>  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
<a id='L211' name='L211'></a>produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
<a id='L212' name='L212'></a>terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<a id='L213' name='L213'></a>
<a id='L214' name='L214'></a>    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
<a id='L215' name='L215'></a>    it, and giving a relevant date.
<a id='L216' name='L216'></a>
<a id='L217' name='L217'></a>    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
<a id='L218' name='L218'></a>    released under this License and any conditions added under section
<a id='L219' name='L219'></a>    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
<a id='L220' name='L220'></a>    "keep intact all notices".
<a id='L221' name='L221'></a>
<a id='L222' name='L222'></a>    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
<a id='L223' name='L223'></a>    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
<a id='L224' name='L224'></a>    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
<a id='L225' name='L225'></a>    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
<a id='L226' name='L226'></a>    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
<a id='L227' name='L227'></a>    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
<a id='L228' name='L228'></a>    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
<a id='L229' name='L229'></a>
<a id='L230' name='L230'></a>    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
<a id='L231' name='L231'></a>    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
<a id='L232' name='L232'></a>    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
<a id='L233' name='L233'></a>    work need not make them do so.
<a id='L234' name='L234'></a>
<a id='L235' name='L235'></a>  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
<a id='L236' name='L236'></a>works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
<a id='L237' name='L237'></a>and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
<a id='L238' name='L238'></a>in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
<a id='L239' name='L239'></a>"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
<a id='L240' name='L240'></a>used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
<a id='L241' name='L241'></a>beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
<a id='L242' name='L242'></a>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
<a id='L243' name='L243'></a>parts of the aggregate.
<a id='L244' name='L244'></a>
<a id='L245' name='L245'></a>  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
<a id='L246' name='L246'></a>
<a id='L247' name='L247'></a>  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
<a id='L248' name='L248'></a>of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
<a id='L249' name='L249'></a>machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
<a id='L250' name='L250'></a>in one of these ways:
<a id='L251' name='L251'></a>
<a id='L252' name='L252'></a>    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
<a id='L253' name='L253'></a>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
<a id='L254' name='L254'></a>    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
<a id='L255' name='L255'></a>    customarily used for software interchange.
<a id='L256' name='L256'></a>
<a id='L257' name='L257'></a>    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
<a id='L258' name='L258'></a>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
<a id='L259' name='L259'></a>    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
<a id='L260' name='L260'></a>    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
<a id='L261' name='L261'></a>    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
<a id='L262' name='L262'></a>    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
<a id='L263' name='L263'></a>    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
<a id='L264' name='L264'></a>    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
<a id='L265' name='L265'></a>    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
<a id='L266' name='L266'></a>    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
<a id='L267' name='L267'></a>    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
<a id='L268' name='L268'></a>
<a id='L269' name='L269'></a>    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
<a id='L270' name='L270'></a>    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
<a id='L271' name='L271'></a>    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
<a id='L272' name='L272'></a>    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
<a id='L273' name='L273'></a>    with subsection 6b.
<a id='L274' name='L274'></a>
<a id='L275' name='L275'></a>    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
<a id='L276' name='L276'></a>    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
<a id='L277' name='L277'></a>    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
<a id='L278' name='L278'></a>    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
<a id='L279' name='L279'></a>    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
<a id='L280' name='L280'></a>    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
<a id='L281' name='L281'></a>    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
<a id='L282' name='L282'></a>    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
<a id='L283' name='L283'></a>    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
<a id='L284' name='L284'></a>    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
<a id='L285' name='L285'></a>    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
<a id='L286' name='L286'></a>    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
<a id='L287' name='L287'></a>
<a id='L288' name='L288'></a>    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
<a id='L289' name='L289'></a>    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
<a id='L290' name='L290'></a>    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
<a id='L291' name='L291'></a>    charge under subsection 6d.
<a id='L292' name='L292'></a>
<a id='L293' name='L293'></a>  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
<a id='L294' name='L294'></a>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
<a id='L295' name='L295'></a>included in conveying the object code work.
<a id='L296' name='L296'></a>
<a id='L297' name='L297'></a>  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
<a id='L298' name='L298'></a>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
<a id='L299' name='L299'></a>or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
<a id='L300' name='L300'></a>into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
<a id='L301' name='L301'></a>doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
<a id='L302' name='L302'></a>product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
<a id='L303' name='L303'></a>typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
<a id='L304' name='L304'></a>of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
<a id='L305' name='L305'></a>actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
<a id='L306' name='L306'></a>is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
<a id='L307' name='L307'></a>commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
<a id='L308' name='L308'></a>the only significant mode of use of the product.
<a id='L309' name='L309'></a>
<a id='L310' name='L310'></a>  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
<a id='L311' name='L311'></a>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
<a id='L312' name='L312'></a>and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
<a id='L313' name='L313'></a>a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
<a id='L314' name='L314'></a>suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
<a id='L315' name='L315'></a>code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
<a id='L316' name='L316'></a>modification has been made.
<a id='L317' name='L317'></a>
<a id='L318' name='L318'></a>  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
<a id='L319' name='L319'></a>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
<a id='L320' name='L320'></a>part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
<a id='L321' name='L321'></a>User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
<a id='L322' name='L322'></a>fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
<a id='L323' name='L323'></a>Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
<a id='L324' name='L324'></a>by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
<a id='L325' name='L325'></a>if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
<a id='L326' name='L326'></a>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
<a id='L327' name='L327'></a>been installed in ROM).
<a id='L328' name='L328'></a>
<a id='L329' name='L329'></a>  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
<a id='L330' name='L330'></a>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
<a id='L331' name='L331'></a>for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
<a id='L332' name='L332'></a>the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
<a id='L333' name='L333'></a>network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
<a id='L334' name='L334'></a>adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
<a id='L335' name='L335'></a>protocols for communication across the network.
<a id='L336' name='L336'></a>
<a id='L337' name='L337'></a>  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
<a id='L338' name='L338'></a>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
<a id='L339' name='L339'></a>documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
<a id='L340' name='L340'></a>source code form), and must require no special password or key for
<a id='L341' name='L341'></a>unpacking, reading or copying.
<a id='L342' name='L342'></a>
<a id='L343' name='L343'></a>  7. Additional Terms.
<a id='L344' name='L344'></a>
<a id='L345' name='L345'></a>  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
<a id='L346' name='L346'></a>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
<a id='L347' name='L347'></a>Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
<a id='L348' name='L348'></a>be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
<a id='L349' name='L349'></a>that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
<a id='L350' name='L350'></a>apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
<a id='L351' name='L351'></a>under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
<a id='L352' name='L352'></a>this License without regard to the additional permissions.
<a id='L353' name='L353'></a>
<a id='L354' name='L354'></a>  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
<a id='L355' name='L355'></a>remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
<a id='L356' name='L356'></a>it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
<a id='L357' name='L357'></a>removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
<a id='L358' name='L358'></a>additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
<a id='L359' name='L359'></a>for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
<a id='L360' name='L360'></a>
<a id='L361' name='L361'></a>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
<a id='L362' name='L362'></a>add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
<a id='L363' name='L363'></a>that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
<a id='L364' name='L364'></a>
<a id='L365' name='L365'></a>    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
<a id='L366' name='L366'></a>    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
<a id='L367' name='L367'></a>
<a id='L368' name='L368'></a>    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
<a id='L369' name='L369'></a>    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
<a id='L370' name='L370'></a>    Notices displayed by works containing it; or
<a id='L371' name='L371'></a>
<a id='L372' name='L372'></a>    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
<a id='L373' name='L373'></a>    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
<a id='L374' name='L374'></a>    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
<a id='L375' name='L375'></a>
<a id='L376' name='L376'></a>    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
<a id='L377' name='L377'></a>    authors of the material; or
<a id='L378' name='L378'></a>
<a id='L379' name='L379'></a>    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
<a id='L380' name='L380'></a>    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
<a id='L381' name='L381'></a>
<a id='L382' name='L382'></a>    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
<a id='L383' name='L383'></a>    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
<a id='L384' name='L384'></a>    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
<a id='L385' name='L385'></a>    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
<a id='L386' name='L386'></a>    those licensors and authors.
<a id='L387' name='L387'></a>
<a id='L388' name='L388'></a>  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
<a id='L389' name='L389'></a>restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
<a id='L390' name='L390'></a>received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
<a id='L391' name='L391'></a>governed by this License along with a term that is a further
<a id='L392' name='L392'></a>restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
<a id='L393' name='L393'></a>a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
<a id='L394' name='L394'></a>License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
<a id='L395' name='L395'></a>of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
<a id='L396' name='L396'></a>not survive such relicensing or conveying.
<a id='L397' name='L397'></a>
<a id='L398' name='L398'></a>  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
<a id='L399' name='L399'></a>must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
<a id='L400' name='L400'></a>additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
<a id='L401' name='L401'></a>where to find the applicable terms.
<a id='L402' name='L402'></a>
<a id='L403' name='L403'></a>  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
<a id='L404' name='L404'></a>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
<a id='L405' name='L405'></a>the above requirements apply either way.
<a id='L406' name='L406'></a>
<a id='L407' name='L407'></a>  8. Termination.
<a id='L408' name='L408'></a>
<a id='L409' name='L409'></a>  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
<a id='L410' name='L410'></a>provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
<a id='L411' name='L411'></a>modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
<a id='L412' name='L412'></a>this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
<a id='L413' name='L413'></a>paragraph of section 11).
<a id='L414' name='L414'></a>
<a id='L415' name='L415'></a>  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
<a id='L416' name='L416'></a>license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
<a id='L417' name='L417'></a>provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
<a id='L418' name='L418'></a>finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
<a id='L419' name='L419'></a>holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
<a id='L420' name='L420'></a>prior to 60 days after the cessation.
<a id='L421' name='L421'></a>
<a id='L422' name='L422'></a>  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
<a id='L423' name='L423'></a>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
<a id='L424' name='L424'></a>violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
<a id='L425' name='L425'></a>received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
<a id='L426' name='L426'></a>copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
<a id='L427' name='L427'></a>your receipt of the notice.
<a id='L428' name='L428'></a>
<a id='L429' name='L429'></a>  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
<a id='L430' name='L430'></a>licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
<a id='L431' name='L431'></a>this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
<a id='L432' name='L432'></a>reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
<a id='L433' name='L433'></a>material under section 10.
<a id='L434' name='L434'></a>
<a id='L435' name='L435'></a>  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
<a id='L436' name='L436'></a>
<a id='L437' name='L437'></a>  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
<a id='L438' name='L438'></a>run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
<a id='L439' name='L439'></a>occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
<a id='L440' name='L440'></a>to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
<a id='L441' name='L441'></a>nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
<a id='L442' name='L442'></a>modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
<a id='L443' name='L443'></a>not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
<a id='L444' name='L444'></a>covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
<a id='L445' name='L445'></a>
<a id='L446' name='L446'></a>  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
<a id='L447' name='L447'></a>
<a id='L448' name='L448'></a>  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
<a id='L449' name='L449'></a>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
<a id='L450' name='L450'></a>propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
<a id='L451' name='L451'></a>for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
<a id='L452' name='L452'></a>
<a id='L453' name='L453'></a>  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
<a id='L454' name='L454'></a>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
<a id='L455' name='L455'></a>organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
<a id='L456' name='L456'></a>work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
<a id='L457' name='L457'></a>transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
<a id='L458' name='L458'></a>licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
<a id='L459' name='L459'></a>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
<a id='L460' name='L460'></a>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
<a id='L461' name='L461'></a>the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
<a id='L462' name='L462'></a>
<a id='L463' name='L463'></a>  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
<a id='L464' name='L464'></a>rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
<a id='L465' name='L465'></a>not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
<a id='L466' name='L466'></a>rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
<a id='L467' name='L467'></a>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
<a id='L468' name='L468'></a>any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
<a id='L469' name='L469'></a>sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
<a id='L470' name='L470'></a>
<a id='L471' name='L471'></a>  11. Patents.
<a id='L472' name='L472'></a>
<a id='L473' name='L473'></a>  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
<a id='L474' name='L474'></a>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
<a id='L475' name='L475'></a>work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
<a id='L476' name='L476'></a>
<a id='L477' name='L477'></a>  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
<a id='L478' name='L478'></a>owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
<a id='L479' name='L479'></a>hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
<a id='L480' name='L480'></a>by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
<a id='L481' name='L481'></a>but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
<a id='L482' name='L482'></a>consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
<a id='L483' name='L483'></a>purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
<a id='L484' name='L484'></a>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
<a id='L485' name='L485'></a>this License.
<a id='L486' name='L486'></a>
<a id='L487' name='L487'></a>  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
<a id='L488' name='L488'></a>patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
<a id='L489' name='L489'></a>make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
<a id='L490' name='L490'></a>propagate the contents of its contributor version.
<a id='L491' name='L491'></a>
<a id='L492' name='L492'></a>  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
<a id='L493' name='L493'></a>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
<a id='L494' name='L494'></a>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
<a id='L495' name='L495'></a>sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
<a id='L496' name='L496'></a>party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
<a id='L497' name='L497'></a>patent against the party.
<a id='L498' name='L498'></a>
<a id='L499' name='L499'></a>  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
<a id='L500' name='L500'></a>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
<a id='L501' name='L501'></a>to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
<a id='L502' name='L502'></a>publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
<a id='L503' name='L503'></a>then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
<a id='L504' name='L504'></a>available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
<a id='L505' name='L505'></a>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
<a id='L506' name='L506'></a>consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
<a id='L507' name='L507'></a>license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
<a id='L508' name='L508'></a>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
<a id='L509' name='L509'></a>covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
<a id='L510' name='L510'></a>in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
<a id='L511' name='L511'></a>country that you have reason to believe are valid.
<a id='L512' name='L512'></a>
<a id='L513' name='L513'></a>  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
<a id='L514' name='L514'></a>arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
<a id='L515' name='L515'></a>covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
<a id='L516' name='L516'></a>receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
<a id='L517' name='L517'></a>or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
<a id='L518' name='L518'></a>you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
<a id='L519' name='L519'></a>work and works based on it.
<a id='L520' name='L520'></a>
<a id='L521' name='L521'></a>  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
<a id='L522' name='L522'></a>the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
<a id='L523' name='L523'></a>conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
<a id='L524' name='L524'></a>specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
<a id='L525' name='L525'></a>work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
<a id='L526' name='L526'></a>in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
<a id='L527' name='L527'></a>to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
<a id='L528' name='L528'></a>the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
<a id='L529' name='L529'></a>parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
<a id='L530' name='L530'></a>patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
<a id='L531' name='L531'></a>conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
<a id='L532' name='L532'></a>for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
<a id='L533' name='L533'></a>contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
<a id='L534' name='L534'></a>or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
<a id='L535' name='L535'></a>
<a id='L536' name='L536'></a>  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
<a id='L537' name='L537'></a>any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
<a id='L538' name='L538'></a>otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
<a id='L539' name='L539'></a>
<a id='L540' name='L540'></a>  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
<a id='L541' name='L541'></a>
<a id='L542' name='L542'></a>  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<a id='L543' name='L543'></a>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<a id='L544' name='L544'></a>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
<a id='L545' name='L545'></a>covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
<a id='L546' name='L546'></a>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
<a id='L547' name='L547'></a>not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
<a id='L548' name='L548'></a>to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
<a id='L549' name='L549'></a>the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
<a id='L550' name='L550'></a>License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
<a id='L551' name='L551'></a>
<a id='L552' name='L552'></a>  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
<a id='L553' name='L553'></a>
<a id='L554' name='L554'></a>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
<a id='L555' name='L555'></a>permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
<a id='L556' name='L556'></a>under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
<a id='L557' name='L557'></a>combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
<a id='L558' name='L558'></a>License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
<a id='L559' name='L559'></a>but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
<a id='L560' name='L560'></a>section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
<a id='L561' name='L561'></a>combination as such.
<a id='L562' name='L562'></a>
<a id='L563' name='L563'></a>  14. Revised Versions of this License.
<a id='L564' name='L564'></a>
<a id='L565' name='L565'></a>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
<a id='L566' name='L566'></a>the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
<a id='L567' name='L567'></a>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
<a id='L568' name='L568'></a>address new problems or concerns.
<a id='L569' name='L569'></a>
<a id='L570' name='L570'></a>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
<a id='L571' name='L571'></a>Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
<a id='L572' name='L572'></a>Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
<a id='L573' name='L573'></a>option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
<a id='L574' name='L574'></a>version or of any later version published by the Free Software
<a id='L575' name='L575'></a>Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
<a id='L576' name='L576'></a>GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
<a id='L577' name='L577'></a>by the Free Software Foundation.
<a id='L578' name='L578'></a>
<a id='L579' name='L579'></a>  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
<a id='L580' name='L580'></a>versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
<a id='L581' name='L581'></a>public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
<a id='L582' name='L582'></a>to choose that version for the Program.
<a id='L583' name='L583'></a>
<a id='L584' name='L584'></a>  Later license versions may give you additional or different
<a id='L585' name='L585'></a>permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
<a id='L586' name='L586'></a>author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
<a id='L587' name='L587'></a>later version.
<a id='L588' name='L588'></a>
<a id='L589' name='L589'></a>  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
<a id='L590' name='L590'></a>
<a id='L591' name='L591'></a>  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
<a id='L592' name='L592'></a>APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
<a id='L593' name='L593'></a>HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
<a id='L594' name='L594'></a>OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
<a id='L595' name='L595'></a>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<a id='L596' name='L596'></a>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
<a id='L597' name='L597'></a>IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
<a id='L598' name='L598'></a>ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<a id='L599' name='L599'></a>
<a id='L600' name='L600'></a>  16. Limitation of Liability.
<a id='L601' name='L601'></a>
<a id='L602' name='L602'></a>  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
<a id='L603' name='L603'></a>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
<a id='L604' name='L604'></a>THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
<a id='L605' name='L605'></a>GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
<a id='L606' name='L606'></a>USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
<a id='L607' name='L607'></a>DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
<a id='L608' name='L608'></a>PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
<a id='L609' name='L609'></a>EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
<a id='L610' name='L610'></a>SUCH DAMAGES.
<a id='L611' name='L611'></a>
<a id='L612' name='L612'></a>  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
<a id='L613' name='L613'></a>
<a id='L614' name='L614'></a>  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
<a id='L615' name='L615'></a>above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
<a id='L616' name='L616'></a>reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
<a id='L617' name='L617'></a>an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
<a id='L618' name='L618'></a>Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
<a id='L619' name='L619'></a>copy of the Program in return for a fee.
<a id='L620' name='L620'></a>
<a id='L621' name='L621'></a>                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<a id='L622' name='L622'></a>
<a id='L623' name='L623'></a>            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<a id='L624' name='L624'></a>
<a id='L625' name='L625'></a>  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<a id='L626' name='L626'></a>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<a id='L627' name='L627'></a>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<a id='L628' name='L628'></a>
<a id='L629' name='L629'></a>  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
<a id='L630' name='L630'></a>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
<a id='L631' name='L631'></a>state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
<a id='L632' name='L632'></a>the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<a id='L633' name='L633'></a>
<a id='L634' name='L634'></a>    {one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.}
<a id='L635' name='L635'></a>    Copyright (C) {year}  {name of author}
<a id='L636' name='L636'></a>
<a id='L637' name='L637'></a>    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
<a id='L638' name='L638'></a>    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<a id='L639' name='L639'></a>    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
<a id='L640' name='L640'></a>    (at your option) any later version.
<a id='L641' name='L641'></a>
<a id='L642' name='L642'></a>    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
<a id='L643' name='L643'></a>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<a id='L644' name='L644'></a>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
<a id='L645' name='L645'></a>    GNU General Public License for more details.
<a id='L646' name='L646'></a>
<a id='L647' name='L647'></a>    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<a id='L648' name='L648'></a>    along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
<a id='L649' name='L649'></a>
<a id='L650' name='L650'></a>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<a id='L651' name='L651'></a>
<a id='L652' name='L652'></a>  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
<a id='L653' name='L653'></a>notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
<a id='L654' name='L654'></a>
<a id='L655' name='L655'></a>    {project}  Copyright (C) {year}  {fullname}
<a id='L656' name='L656'></a>    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
<a id='L657' name='L657'></a>    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
<a id='L658' name='L658'></a>    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<a id='L659' name='L659'></a>
<a id='L660' name='L660'></a>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
<a id='L661' name='L661'></a>parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
<a id='L662' name='L662'></a>might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
<a id='L663' name='L663'></a>
<a id='L664' name='L664'></a>  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
<a id='L665' name='L665'></a>if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
<a id='L666' name='L666'></a>For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<a id='L667' name='L667'></a>&lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
<a id='L668' name='L668'></a>
<a id='L669' name='L669'></a>  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<a id='L670' name='L670'></a>into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
<a id='L671' name='L671'></a>may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
<a id='L672' name='L672'></a>the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
<a id='L673' name='L673'></a>Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
